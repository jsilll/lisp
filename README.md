# Lang (Name TBD)

This repo is a compiler for a toy language built in Rust and LLVM. It is designed to be easy to understand and to serve as a learning tool for both programming language concepts, Rust and LLVM.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To try the language you need to have Rust and LLVM installed. You can install Rust from the
[Rust Website](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and LLVM from the [LLVM Website](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html).

## Usage

Once you Rust and all the project dependencies installed as well as LLVM you can use this crate to compile the language to LLVM IR.

# Syntax (TBD)

- Function definitions with the fn keyword, with argument names and types, return type and a body of expressions.
- Logic Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Boolean, Integer, Float, Double, Char and String primitive types.

# Contributing

Contributions to the language are welcome! If you find a bug or would like to suggest an improvement, please open an issue or a pull request.
